# Regression-Analysis-to-the-PM10
1.Introduction:

The sources of data were from the Central Weather Bureau and Environmental Protection Administration open data,  
then we could obtain monthly average data of air quality, temperature and relative humidity from January 2015 
to November 2020 in Xitun District,  Taichung City.
We used the Linear Regression Model to explore the air quality, 
temperature and relative humidity to the PM10 (Î¼m).

2.Research method:

a. Variable Selection : All Possible Regression , Backward Elimination, Forward Selection 

b. Build Model

c. Compare Model

d. Model Adequacy Checking
